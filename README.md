**UNMAINTAINED:** this project is no longer being actively maintained.

This repository has been left online in case it proves useful to you, but be aware that this
code likely requires minor and major tweaks to be used with a recent driver package.

Description
-----------

This project provided an **unofficial**, **unsupported**, **third-party**
Python interface to Advantech DAQ hardware, in the form of a Cython wrapper for
their C++ SDK.

Supported Functionality
-----------------------

The entirety of the API has not yet been wrapped. Initial support is limited to
basic digital and analog I/O.

Installation
------------

### Advantech SDK

The first and essential step is to download and install the Advantech driver
and SDK for Linux. These can be tricky to find, but are in fact [available from
the Advantech
site](http://support.advantech.com.tw/Support/DownloadSRDetail_New.aspx?SR_ID=1-LXHFQJ&Doc_Source=Download).

This library has been most recently tested with
`linux_driver_package_3.1.7.0_64bit.zip`. After downloading and extracting this
package, install the following packages inside the "drivers" and "SDK"
directories:

* biokernbase-dkms
* bio&lt;device&gt; (where &lt;device&gt; is, e.g., "4704")
* libbio<device>
* libbiodaq

On a Debian-based OS, the typical installation method is `sudo dpkg -i`.

### Library

After installing the Advantech software, installation of this Python library
should be straightforward using pip and PyPI:

```sh
$ pip install pybdaq
```

As usual, the use of a virtualenv is strongly recommended.
